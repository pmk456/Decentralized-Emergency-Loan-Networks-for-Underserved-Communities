# Decentralized Emergency Loan Networks for Underserved Communities

This project is a blockchain-based decentralized platform designed to provide fast, transparent, and accessible emergency microloans to underserved communities. The goal is to eliminate the reliance on traditional financial intermediaries and offer a more inclusive solution through smart contracts and peer-to-peer lending.

## Project Overview

Access to emergency loans is still a major challenge for many individuals, especially those in low-income or rural communities. Traditional banking systems often fail to serve these groups due to lack of credit history, documentation, or collateral. This project leverages the power of blockchain to solve these problems by:

- Facilitating trustless peer-to-peer lending using smart contracts
- Offering transparent, auditable loan terms
- Building borrower credibility through on-chain reputation
- Enabling fast loan disbursement without paperwork or banks

## Key Features

- Decentralized lending network powered by blockchain
- Smart contract-driven loan agreements
- On-chain credit scoring and history tracking
- Low-cost microloan processing
- Open access for borrowers and lenders without discrimination

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum (or compatible EVM chain)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: React.js (optional)
- **Backend/API**: Node.js / Express.js (optional)
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask or WalletConnect
- **Data Storage**: IPFS / On-chain (for essential data)

## Use Case

Imagine a woman in a rural area who needs a small loan to pay for a sudden medical expense. Without access to formal banking, she could use this platform to request a loan, agree to fair terms, and receive funds from a lenderâ€”all without leaving her home or needing a bank account.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:pmk456/Decentralized-Emergency-Loan-Networks-for-Underserved-Communities.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```
   cd Decentralized-Emergency-Loan-Networks-for-Underserved-Communities
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables and blockchain provider (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).

4. Deploy the smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

5. Start the frontend (if applicable):
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate decentralized identity (DID) verification
- Add a mobile-first version for low-bandwidth regions
- Implement DAO-based governance for loan approval
- Introduce AI-powered credit scoring using alternative data
